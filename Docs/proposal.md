Project Proposal
We will make a Poker application called A Lytle Poker Game using Java.  It will be developed in JavaFX using NetBeans.  
We will have version control handled by GitHub.    

Poker will include rounds of betting until one person walks away with the total pot.  We will have 2 game modes. 
The game will end when one player has won the entire pot. It will support 2-5 players.    

Cards will be reshuffled at the beginning of each hand.  The standard 52 card deck will be used without wild cards.  
The game assets (cards, playing table, etc.) are to be created by hand.    

The status of the pot, playerâ€™s hands, and game logic will be kept on the server side to avoid cheating.    

We plan to use an asynchronous model since poker is a turn-based game.  
We will have a server and a GUI client for players to connect to the game.  
The server might be open source, such as the one found at [https://github.com/jacobhyphenated/PokerServer](https://github.com/jacobhyphenated/PokerServer) 
We will create the GUI client to play the game.
